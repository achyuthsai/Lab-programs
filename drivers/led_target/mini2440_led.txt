S3C2440A has 130 multi-functional input/output port pins and
there are eight ports.
And 4 LED's are connected to GPB5,GPB6,GPB7,GPB8 respectively.

	GPB5:LED1
	GPB6:LED2

	GPB8:LED4

PORT CONTROL DESCRIPTIONS:

PORT B CONFIGURATION REGISTER (GPBCON):
The PGBCON(port control register) determines which function
is used for each pin.


PORT DATA REGISTER (GPBDAT):
If Ports are configured as output ports, data can be written to
the corresponding bit of GPBDAT. If Ports are configured as input
ports, the data can be read from the corresponding bit of GPBDAT.

PORT PULL-UP REGISTER (GPBUP):
The port pull-up register controls the pull-up resister enable/disable
of each port group. When the corresponding bit is 0, the pull-up 
resister of the pin is enabled. When 1, the pull-up resister is disabled.

GPBDAT       BIT         DESCRIPTION
GPBDAT      [10:0]      When the port is configured as input port, the corresponding bit is the pin
                        state. When the port is configured as output port, the pin state is the same as
                        the corresponding bit. When the port is configured as functional pin, the
                        undefined value will be read.

GPBUP       BIT           DESCRIPTION
GPBUP      [10:0]       0: the pull up function attached to to the corresponding port pin is enabled.
			1: the pull up function is disabled.
